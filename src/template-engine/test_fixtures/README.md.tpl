They're forming in a straight line
They're going through a tight wind
The kids are losing their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

They're piling in the back seat
They're generating steam heat
Pulsating to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop.

{{.phrase1}}
Shoot'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all reved up and ready to go
